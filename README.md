# Python Terminal Menu System

A Python library for creating interactive terminal menus with options, submenus (folders), and visual separators. This project supports two navigation modes:

- **Expanded Mode:** Displays the full menu tree with composite numbering (e.g., `1`, `1.1`, `1.1.1`).
- **Collapsed Mode:** Step-by-step navigation where folders open on demand and you can select "Back" to return to the previous level.

## Features

- **Dynamic Options:** Easily add actionable options with corresponding functions.
- **Submenus (Folders):** Organize your menu items in folders (submenus) with nested levels.
- **Visual Separators:** Improve readability with non-selectable separator lines.
- **Automatic Exit Option:** Optionally include an exit option that is automatically added to the menu.
- **Multiple Modes:** Choose between expanded (full tree) and collapsed (step-by-step) navigation.
